Event: 2 fair six sided dice are tossed once

Possible outcomes when the sum of numbers on face of both dices is 6 and both numbers are differnt:
(1,5), (2,4), (4,2), (5,1)

So, number of favourable outcomes = 4
and total number of outcomes in sample space = 6 * 6 = 36

Hence,
P(sum of numbers on face of both dices is 6 and both numbers are differnt) 
    = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
    = 4/36
    = 1/9
